# Quality Metrics Calculator Enhancement - Epic & User Stories

## Epic

**Quality Metrics Calculator Enhancement**

As a software quality engineering team, we need to enhance our command-line calculator to support advanced quality
metric calculations including defect density analysis, shipped source instruction tracking for successive releases, and
Musa Logarithmic reliability modeling.

## User Stories

### US-001: Defect Density Calculation

**As a** quality engineer  
**I want** to calculate the defect density of a system  
**So that** I can assess code quality and compare it against industry standards

### US-002: SSI Tracking for Successive Releases

**As a** release manager  
**I want** to calculate the total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) for successive releases  
**So that** I can track code growth and plan resource allocation for future releases

### US-003: Musa Logarithmic Failure Intensity

**As a** reliability analyst  
**I want** to calculate failure intensity using the Musa Logarithmic model  
**So that** I can predict system reliability trends over time

---

### US-004: Musa Logarithmic Expected Failures

**As a** reliability analyst  
**I want** to calculate the expected number of failures using the Musa Logarithmic model  
**So that** I can estimate failure patterns for project planning

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Calculator accepts initial failure intensity, execution time, and decay parameter
- Uses Musa Logarithmic formula: μ(τ) = ν₀ × ln(λ₀×τ/ν₀ + 1)
- Returns expected number of failures
